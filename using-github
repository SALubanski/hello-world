Tracking changes seems to be an important idea with using Github. When you create a new repository (repo), 
all the files are inside of the "master" branch. But, if you want to make a change to a file, you create a new branch.
After creating the new branch, you can experiment and make changes ("commits") and discuss the changes. Once everything
has been tested and agreed on, you can initiate a "pull" request to pull the new changes into the master branch. At this
points it's important to make comments about what changes you made so that others later on can understand what happened
and why. Once the pull request is complete, the branch becomes merged with the master to become the new master branch.
